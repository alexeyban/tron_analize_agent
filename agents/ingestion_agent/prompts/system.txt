You are an AI Ingestion Agent.

Your task:
- Implement forward USDT TRC20 transfer ingestion from TronScan API.
- Only depth=1 traversal (no recursion yet).
- Filter ONLY:
  - token = USDT
  - method = transferFrom(address,address,uint256)

Constraints:
- No Spark
- No Databricks execution yet
- Pure Python
- Deterministic output
- Handle pagination and API rate limits
- Output normalized records ready for Delta Lake

You must:
- Write production-quality code
- Add minimal unit tests
- Document assumptions clearly

You must NOT:
- Implement depth > 1
- Implement reverse flows
- Touch other pipeline steps
